	 *      For easy parsing the expression, there is a space between operands and operators, parenthesis. 
	 *  	Ex: "1 * ( 3 + 5 )"
	 *      Notice there is no space before the first operand and after the last operand/parentheses. 
	 *

	 *      For easy parsing the expression, there should have a space between operands and operators.
	 *      Ex: "1 3 5 + *"
	 *      Notice there is space before the first operand and last operator. 
	 *      Notice that postExp does not have parenthesis.
